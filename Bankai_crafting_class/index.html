        WATASHI NO NAMAE WA " My name is " OLAROTIMI DANIEL. In the past few weeks,i joined FLIP TO TECH for the 3 in 1 course and i joined without a resolve of what i wanted to do after i have
       acquired the various skills i needed, but the one thing i new was to gather more knowledge and understand better what TECH is all about and in this case i go with Coding, UI/UX, graphics
       design e.t.c But now with FLIP TO TECH and how to orientation went I now understand that TECH is very wide and broad, filled with many opportunities and a lot of things that i don't
       even know where to start, but the particular one i'll be going for will be CYBER SECURITY.As we all know every journey has to start from somewhere and the beginning of my journey will
       start from flip to tech, i hope they can exceed all expectation and impact the knowledge i seek.</h1>
